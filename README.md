#ExampleKeras
This repository contains jupyter notebooks that show how to build a ConvNN using Keras to solve some of the traditional problems in image recognitions such as:

a) Recognize a digits in a 32x32 image using the MNIST10 dataset.

   Take a look to the MINST_and_CNN.ipynb notebook
   
b) Categorize imagenes 64x64 images in 10 different categories using the CIFAR10 dataset.

   Take a look to the CIFAR10_CNN_Keras.ipynb notebook
